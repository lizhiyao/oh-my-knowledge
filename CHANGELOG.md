## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-24

First iteration after the initial public release — product polish + open-source day-1 discoverability.

### Production observability (`omk analyze`)

- Renamed `production-analyzer` → `skill-health-analyzer` (closer to what the report actually shows)
- Separated **execution failure rate** from **knowledge gap rate** (a flaky tool chain is not the same as a missing skill)
- Added **cost / duration / turns** dimensions per skill (billable vs. cached tokens shown separately)
- Added **stability** classification per skill (`stable` / `unstable` / `very-unstable`) with 20% / 40% failure-rate thresholds
- Skill attribution signal 3: fallback via `Read SKILL.md` when the session didn't invoke the Skill tool explicitly
- Aligned `omk analyze` output with `omk bench` — JSON-only artifact, HTML rendered on-demand by `omk bench report`

### Report server

- **Skill health trend** page: per-skill time series (gap / weighted-gap / failure / coverage / tokens / duration)
- **Skill health diff** page: side-by-side comparison of two analyses with sort + removed/new tags
- Observability pages fully internationalized (EN / ZH), language choice persists across pages via URL + localStorage
- Version fingerprint UX: labeled "Version fingerprint" / "版本指纹" with tooltip, truncated to first 12 hex of SHA-256

### Offline evaluation (`omk bench`)

- Fixed `--each --repeat N` silently swallowing repeat (each-branch now threads `repeat`/`each` through `EvaluationRequest`)
- Fixed `--each` mode incorrectly requiring `--control` / `--treatment` variant-role arguments
- Per-skill variance now surfaces correctly in `--each` mode (was previously discarded)
- Unified separator in each-mode overview subtitle (`·` instead of mixing `·` and `×`)

### Open source

- English-first README with `README.zh.md` mirror; top-bar language switcher
- Gitflow branching model: `main` for tagged releases, `develop` for integration (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- npm keywords expanded to 9 (added `claude-code`, `prompt-engineering`, `evaluation-framework`); added `homepage` and `bugs` fields
- Community files: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue forms templates, PR template
- GitHub topics enriched with `claude-code` + `evaluation-framework`

### Developer experience

- Unified "six-dimension" terminology across README / docs / renderer (replaced stale "four-dimension" references)
- Per-page language persistence in report server
- CI runs `yarn build` before `yarn test` (fixes `test/cli.test.ts` dependency on `dist/`)

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-23

Initial public release.

### Offline evaluation (`omk bench`)

- Controlled-variable experiments: fix the model and samples, vary only the artifact and runtime context
- Six-dimension scoring shown independently: **Fact / Behavior / LLM-judge / Cost / Efficiency / Stability**
- 18 assertion types (substring, regex, JSON Schema, semantic similarity, tool-call behavior, custom JS, cost / latency caps, …)
- Multi-executor support: Claude CLI / Claude SDK / OpenAI / Gemini / Anthropic API / OpenAI API / any custom command
- Batch mode `--each` for evaluating multiple independent artifacts vs baseline in one run
- Multi-run variance analysis `--repeat N` with Welch t-test, Cohen's d, 95% CI independently per scoring layer
- Blind A/B mode, interleaved scheduling, parallel execution, result caching, artifact version fingerprint
- Knowledge-gap signals with severity weighting and LLM-assisted hedging classification (quantify risk exposure, not completeness proof)
- CI gate `omk bench ci` with three-layer all-pass semantics (catches single-layer regressions the composite would hide)
- Self-iterating improvement `omk bench evolve` (LLM rewrites → re-evaluate → keep if better → repeat)
- MCP-based URL fetching for private-doc URLs (SSO-protected knowledge bases)

### Production observability (`omk analyze`)

- Skill-health reports from Claude Code session traces: coverage / gap signals / execution stability / token & latency per skill
- Time-window filtering (`--last 7d` / `--from` / `--to`), skill whitelist, auto-inferred knowledge-base root
- Execution-stability warning when a skill's tool-failure rate exceeds 20% (flags gap signals as possibly environmental noise)
- Skill health **trend** view (per-skill time series: gap / failure / coverage / tokens)
- Skill health **diff** view (side-by-side comparison of two reports)

### Report server

- Local HTML report service (`omk bench report`), browses eval reports and skill-health reports in one place
- EN / ZH one-click language toggle, language choice persists across pages
- Evaluation-as-code via `eval.yaml` config

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 20
- `claude` CLI for the default executor and LLM judge; optional when using other executors with `--no-judge`
